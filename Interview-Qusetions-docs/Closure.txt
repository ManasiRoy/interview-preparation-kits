A closure is a feature in JavaScript where a function retains access to variables from its outer (enclosing) scope, even after the outer function has finished executing. In simpler terms, a closure allows a function to remember and access the variables in the scope where it was created.

const ParentFunc = () => {
  let name = "Parent Div";
  
  const ChildFunc = () => {
    let name = "I'm Child Div"
    console.log(name)
  }
  ChildFunc();
  console.log(name)
}
ParentFunc()
