// React Redux flow Example

Here's an overview of the React Redux flow:

Actions:
Actions are the same as in regular Redux.They are plain JavaScript objects that describe an event in your application.React Redux components dispatch actions to signal state changes.

Reducers:
Reducers are also the same as in regular Redux.They are pure functions that update the state based on the dispatched actions.

Redux Store:
The Redux store is the same store from the core Redux library.It holds the complete state of the application.However, in React Redux, you need to provide this store to the React components in a specific way.

Connect Function:
The connect function provided by React Redux is used to connect React components to the Redux store. It's a higher-order component that wraps your component, allowing it to access the store's state and dispatch actions.

Provider Component:
The Provider component from React Redux is used to wrap the top - level component of your React application. It ensures that the Redux store is available to all components in the component tree, allowing you to connect any component to the store.

Selectors:
Selectors are functions that retrieve specific pieces of data from the Redux store's state. They help keep the components decoupled from the store's structure.
